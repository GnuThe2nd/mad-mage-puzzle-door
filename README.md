# The Mad Mages Puzzle Door



This is a puzzle door add-on for the D&D module "Waterdeep: Dungeon of the Mad Mage". This page is meant for the DM's eyes only, as it contains code and solution for the door. It is possible for the DM to generate their own solutions locally. 

It adds a puzzle door for every level (except Lost Level) and culminates with the giant puzzle door at the Mad Mages Lair.
