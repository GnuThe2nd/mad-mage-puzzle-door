# The Mad Mages Puzzle Door

This is a puzzle door add-on for the D&D module "Waterdeep: Dungeon of the Mad Mage". This page is meant for the DM's eyes only, as it contains code and solution for the door. It is possible for the DM to generate their own solutions locally. 

It adds a puzzle door for every level (except Lost Level) and culminates with the giant puzzle door at the Mad Mages Lair.

## Inspirations
I had been wanting to run "DotMM" for my group for a while, combined with "Keys From the Golden Vault". I told my players that this would be a stealthy heist campaign, so they all made fragile characters, with great out of combat utility. Now, for those who don't know, the Undermountain is not exactly what anyone would call "safe". Thus it came apparent to me, that my players would most likely try to sneak through the entire thing, with zero to non interraction with all the cool stuff. I started cooking and my plan was simple: Every level of the undermountiain would need a key to unlock it, and to get the keys, the players would have to explore all of the dungeon and possibly finish a heist. The first level was a blast and it seemed my idea worked out well.

Some time after I was watching DoshDoshington's Factorio Space Exploration run on Youtube and thought that the alterante ending puzzle was very interresting and decided to adapt it to D&D. Sadly, Factorio requires the player to do 3D vector math and seeing that my table harboured players with nonexsistant mathematical backgrounds, I decided to do something else. So then I discovered the Runes. Ofcourse!!! The Runes! There were exactly 9 of them, which made for a nice keydial and there were almost enought levels to build a nice pyramid. So I went ahead with this small passionproject and had fun doing it. Feel free to use this in your games, however you see fit.
